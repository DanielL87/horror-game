        <p>I move closer to the window. For a moment, I think I see him there. But A cold emptiness stands where I thought 'he' was. The street is deserted. Wet concrete shining indifferently. A shiver goes through me as I turn from the window. It's then that I see it. Just below the sliver of space between my bedroom door and the floor a barely visible shadow standing perfectly still. Inhumanly still.</p>
        <p>I decide to ...</p>

          <p>I yell "who's there!?". The only return voice I hear is a barely audible chuckle. A chuckle devoid of any mirth or warmth. After a time which seems an eternity, the shadow of feet recede. There is no noise. An absolute stillness permeates the house.</p>

        <p>I quietly make my way to my Dad's office and am suprised. The door isn't locked. I turn the handle very slowly so it makes no noise. The only sound is a slight creak from the wooden floorboards. I enter the office searching for the handgun I know is here but have been strictly forbidden from touching.</p>
        <p>After moments of searching, I finally find my prize in the top drawer of the desk. My dad has few rules but this one is absolute. Do I take the weapon?</p>

      <p>My mind scrambles trying to think of where they could have possibly gone. I fear that the figure has done something horrible to them.</p>
      <p>At this point I realize that I must find a weapon to protect myself. My dad has strictly forbidden me from grabbing his gun, but it is tne only option, unless I choose to be unarmed...</p>
