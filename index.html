        <p>I move closer to the window. For a moment, I think I see him there. But A cold emptiness stands where I thought 'he' was. The street is deserted. Wet concrete shining indifferently. A shiver goes through me as I turn from the window. It's then that I see it. Just below the sliver of space between my bedroom door and the floor a barely visible shadow standing perfectly still. Inhumanly still.</p>
        <p>I decide to ...</p>

          <p>I yell "who's there!?". The only return voice I hear is a barely audible chuckle. A chuckle devoid of any mirth or warmth. After a time which seems an eternity, the shadow of feet recede. There is no noise. An absolute stillness permeates the house.</p>
          <p>"My parents!", i think in horror. Will he go for them? I slowly make my way to my parents room. A knock on the door produces no response. I decide to...</p>

        <p>An empty cold looking bed is the only thing I see when I enter my parents bedroom. Wouldn't they have told me if they left for the night? My fear increases with the knowledge of being commpletely alone.</p>
        <p>My mind scrambles trying to think of where they could have possibly gone. I fear that the figure has done something horrible to them.</p>
        <p>At this point I realize that I must find a weapon to protect myself. My dad has strictly forbidden me from grabbing his gun, but it is tne only option, unless I choose to be unarmed...</p>

        <p>I quietly make my way to my Dad's office and am suprised. The door isn't locked. I turn the handle very slowly so it makes no noise. The only sound is a slight creak from the wooden floorboards. I enter the office searching for the handgun I know is here but have been strictly forbidden from touching.</p>
        <p>After moments of searching, I finally find my prize in the top drawer of the desk. My dad has few rules but this one is absolute. Do I take the weapon?</p>

      <p>I decide to not grab the gun out of fear of my dad's reprisal. The fear in me continues and grows. I spend what seems like an eternity sitting in the chair.

      <p>I stand my ground. It’s face is finally in full view. Gnarled, burned flesh in a rough outline of a mocking smile. For a moment life seems to stand still. It speaks. The words feel ancient. Earthly. Like the bowls of hell are speaking directly through the flesh its pupetteering.</p>
      <p>“You parents are dead. Their flesh rests in my bowels.”</p>
      <p>I see the fresh blood stains on his mouth and know he speaks the truth. “I can bring them back.” It states with a flat confidence.</p>
      <p>“Would you like them back”?</p>

        <p>I ask for them to be revived.</p>
        <p>“Only blood pays for blood”.</p>
        <p>THe sounds emanate from the burnt flesh without any visible signs of its mouth moving. A knife is produced from its cloak. I take the knife and press it to my arm. The cold steel bites in to my flesh and the red warmth comes down my arm. It’s nostrils flare. It places its burnt, fleshy mouth beneath the flowing blood.
        <p>My life is restored to me like nothing happened in the morning. The cost, however, will be great. </p>
